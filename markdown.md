# Security Alerting and Monitoring 

## Monitoring computer resources
 (Monitor all entry points such as logins, publicly available services, data storage locations, remote access. React to security events like account access, firewall rulebase, additional scanning)

 ### Systems: 
 Monitor authentications and view where people are logging in from, also monitor the services that are running on the devices including the type of activity and how much activity. You can also check if any backups have been completed on devices and what versions of software are installed. 

### Applications: 
 Major part of monitoring is checking availability and making sure these systems are running, keeps lines of communication open between the software and developers or manufacturers of these applications to be notified of any security issues. Many security breaches have been identified by monitroring the amount of traffic that is being transfered, higher traffic than ususal could indicate a possible attacker attempting to exfiltrate data. 

### Infrastructure:
Monitors the outgoing acitivity for example like remote access systems that have people connecting using VPN. it also monitors how many of those connected are employees, how many are vendors and how many are guest. Firewall and IPS reports are another good source of information that could give a warning if someone is trying to gain access to the systems.
