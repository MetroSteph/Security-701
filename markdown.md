# Security Alerting and Monitoring 

## Monitoring computer resources
 (Monitor all entry points such as logins, publicly available services, data storage locations, remote access. React to security events like account access, firewall rulebase, additional scanning)

 ### Systems: 
 Monitor authentications and view where people are logging in from, also monitor the services that are running on the devices including the type of activity and how much activity. You can also check if any backups have been completed on devices and what versions of software are installed.
